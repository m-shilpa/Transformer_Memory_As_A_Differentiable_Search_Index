In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Types <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Transactional emails </Li> <Li> 2.2 Direct emails <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Mobile email marketing </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Comparison to traditional mail <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Advantages </Li> <Li> 3.2 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Opt - in email advertising </Li> <Li> 5 Legal requirements <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Australia </Li> <Li> 5.2 Canada </Li> <Li> 5.3 European Union </Li> <Li> 5.4 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History </H2> <P> Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> CAUCE -- Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email </Li> <Li> Customer engagement </Li> <Li> Suppression list </Li> <Li> Email spam - Unsolicited email marketing </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` spam unsolicited e-mail '' .

The show , narrated by Future Ted , tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother . Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in `` Something New '' and was promoted to a main character in season 9 . The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti . </P> <P> The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series , including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment . Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky 's wedding ; this scene is shown in `` Last Forever '' , the series finale . The Mother 's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024 , also revealed in the series finale , received a mixed reaction from fans . </P> <P> An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD . In the alternate ending , Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . In the video , future Ted is heard saying , `` ... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning , I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was ... '' , indirectly stating that The Mother is alive . The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling , implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Casting </Li> <Li> 2 Character history <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Name </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Death </Li> <Li> 4 Notes </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Casting ( edit ) </H2> <P> During its first eight seasons , the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother . Well - known actresses often made guest appearances on the show . Many fans expected that another would play one of the most - wanted roles in Hollywood , but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown . Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples , Thomas said that `` We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience '' , similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had `` kept the show alive '' when it began . Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call . </P> <P> They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once ; her musical ability was also helpful , as The Mother had been described as a band member . After competing for the role against at least two others , Milioti filmed her first scene -- for the last episode of season 8 -- having never watched How I Met Your Mother ; she recalled , `` I had ignorance on my side . So I did n't know what it meant . '' Milioti learned of the character 's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer . </P> <H2> Character history ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Mother was born on September 19 , 1984 . </P> <P> The Mother , joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death . After the funeral service , she returns to the apartment to open Max 's last gift to her -- a ukulele . The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love . </P> <P> In `` Wait for It '' , it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella . In `` No Tomorrow '' , Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick 's Day party which she also attended , as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max , her late boyfriend . She is still grieving , but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again , bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating . The two women run into Mitch , her old orchestra instructor ; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment . After they start talking , Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams . The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college . </P> <P> On his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby , as seen in the season 4 finale `` The Leap '' , he is seen in front of the classroom of students , one of which Future Ted says is the titular mother . But in the first episode of season 5 , `` Definitions '' , it is revealed that he was actually in the wrong classroom -- Economics instead of Architecture . At the same time in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , the Mother sits her first session in Economics 305 and meets another graduate student named Cindy ( Rachel Bilson ) , whom she offers to move in with her as her roommate . They see Ted enter the room , but when he announces the subject , The Mother thinks she is in the wrong room and runs off . She heads back to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom . </P> <P> Later , in `` Girls Versus Suits '' , Ted dates Cindy , not knowing that her roommate is his future wife . Throughout the episode , Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate . When in Cindy and the mother 's apartment he picks up many of The Mother 's belongings , attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are ( thinking the items are Cindy 's ) and glimpses the mother 's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower . Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band . Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions , `` this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back . '' In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is revealed that , after Ted left the apartment , the Mother had discovered the umbrella and , upon going to question Cindy , finds her in a state . As she tried to console her , Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted , and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive , before spontaneously kissing her , revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush . While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian , it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating , as the kiss was her first in a long time . </P> <P> Some time after this , a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics . Darren gradually takes over the band . </P> <P> In the season 6 opener `` Big Days '' it is revealed Ted meets his future wife `` the day of '' the wedding at which he is the best man . In the episode `` False Positive '' Robin asks Ted to be her future best man , should she ever get married . In the episode `` Challenge Accepted '' , it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney 's wedding . In the last episode of season 7 , `` The Magician 's Code '' it is shown that Barney will marry Robin , and Ted will meet the mother `` the day of '' their wedding . On the premiere of season 8 , Ted 's wife appears after Barney and Robin 's wedding , outside at the `` Farhampton '' station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar . </P> <P> In the season 8 episode `` Band or DJ ? , '' Ted runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute . The end result of the encounter is that Cindy 's ( now ex - ) roommate 's band plays at Barney and Robin 's wedding . </P> <P> The Mother is first shown meeting Louis in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now - lead band member Darren talks to his fans . Later at MacLaren 's Pub , she tells him she 's not yet ready to date . Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after . </P> <P> The Mother meets all of Ted 's best friends ( Barney , Lily , Marshall and Robin ) before she meets him . The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin , as revealed through a flashback in `` Platonish '' . In `` The Locket '' , Tracy meets Lily on a train journey . </P> <P> In `` Bass Player Wanted '' , the Mother picks up a hitchhiking Marshall , carrying his son Marvin , on her way to Farhampton Inn . On their way , it is revealed that the Mother is a bass player in the band , that is scheduled to play at the wedding reception . But the band 's leader , Darren , forced her to quit . The Mother ultimately decides to confront Darren and retake the band . She ends up alone at the bar , and while practicing a speech to give Darren , Darren walks up to her furious the groom 's best man punched him for `` no reason . '' Amused by this , the Mother laughs , and Darren quits the band in anger . </P> <P> In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is shown that after this incident , the Mother returns to Louis ' summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend . As she walks in the door , Louis proposes to her , but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes . She declines Louis ' proposal and leaves his cottage , going to check in at Farhampton Inn . On her room 's balcony , she plays the ukulele and sings `` La Vie en Rose '' . Ted hears her singing from his room next door . </P> <P> In `` Gary Blauman '' , Ted and the Mother are on their first date . Ted picks her up at her New York City apartment and they proceed to walk to a Scottish - Mexican fusion restaurant for dinner . On the way there , Ted is telling her a story when they nearly have a run - in with Louis . She says that she is in the `` weirdest place on earth '' right now and that it is too soon for her to be dating . Ted walks her back to her apartment . They say goodnight and Ted begins to walk away . The Mother then stops him and asks him to finish the story he was telling her . When the story is over , they say goodnight again . The Mother takes a step towards Ted and they kiss for the first time , before deciding to carry on their date . </P> <P> In a flashforward in `` The Lighthouse '' , Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn . She immediately accepts . In another flashfoward in `` Unpause '' , the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child , Luke , in the year 2017 . She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton . </P> <H3> Name ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Mother 's real name is not revealed until the series finale , `` Last Forever '' . When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station , she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell . In the season 1 episode `` Belly Full of Turkey '' , Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says `` ... that , kids , is the true story of how I met your mother '' . The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking , which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother 's name is Tracy . </P> <H2> Death ( edit ) </H2> See also : Last Forever <P> In the series finale , it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children , Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness . In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead . Ted says that she `` became sick '' and his children saying that she has been `` gone '' for six years . Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother 's death . Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die , but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning . Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was `` an amazing character '' and that `` over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy . Kuchman said that `` asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request '' , that the finale `` advanced too quickly '' and that `` HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue '' . </P> <P> A petition was started , aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale . The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage . On April 5 , 2014 , Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD . No new material was shot for this scene . In the alternate ending , the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . </P> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ The Mother celebrates her 21st birthday on the day that `` Pilot '' is set .

Note that the picture shows several stages of one and the same spermatozoon - only one penetrates the ovum Illustration depicting ovulation and fertilization . <P> Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm , usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell , or fertilized egg , initiating prenatal development . Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century . </P> <P> The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . </P> <P> In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb , in vitro . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Anatomy <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Corona radiata </Li> <Li> 1.2 Cone of attraction and perivitelline membrane </Li> <Li> 1.3 Sperm preparation </Li> <Li> 1.4 Zona pellucida <Ul> <Li> 1.4. 1 Cortical reaction </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Fusion <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Cell membranes </Li> <Li> 2.2 Transformations </Li> <Li> 2.3 Replication </Li> <Li> 2.4 Mitosis </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Fertilization age </Li> <Li> 4 Diseases </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Anatomy ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Corona radiata ( edit ) </H3> <P> The sperm binds through the corona radiata , a layer of follicle cells on the outside of the secondary oocyte . Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell , known as zygote . The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism . </P> <H3> Cone of attraction and perivitelline membrane ( edit ) </H3> <P> Where the spermatozoon is about to pierce , the yolk ( ooplasm ) is drawn out into a conical elevation , termed the cone of attraction or reception cone . Once the spermatozoon has entered , the peripheral portion of the yolk changes into a membrane , the perivitelline membrane , which prevents the passage of additional spermatozoa . </P> <H3> Sperm preparation ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Acrosome reaction <P> At the beginning of the process , the sperm undergoes a series of changes , as freshly ejaculated sperm is unable or poorly able to fertilize . The sperm must undergo capacitation in the female 's reproductive tract over several hours , which increases its motility and destabilizes its membrane , preparing it for the acrosome reaction , the enzymatic penetration of the egg 's tough membrane , the zona pellucida , which surrounds the oocyte . </P> <H3> Zona pellucida ( edit ) </H3> <P> After binding to the corona radiata the sperm reaches the zona pellucida , which is an extra-cellular matrix of glycoproteins . A special complementary molecule on the surface of the sperm head binds to a ZP3 glycoprotein in the zona pellucida . This binding triggers the acrosome to burst , releasing enzymes that help the sperm get through the zona pellucida . </P> <P> Some sperm cells consume their acrosome prematurely on the surface of the egg cell , facilitating the penetration by other sperm cells . As a population , sperm cells have on average 50 % genome similarity so the premature acrosomal reactions aid fertilization by a member of the same cohort . It may be regarded as a mechanism of kin selection . </P> <P> Recent studies have shown that the egg is not passive during this process . </P> Cortical reaction ( edit ) <P> Once the sperm cells find their way past the zona pellucida , the cortical reaction occurs . Cortical granules inside the secondary oocyte fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell , causing enzymes inside these granules to be expelled by exocytosis to the zona pellucida . This in turn causes the glyco - proteins in the zona pellucida to cross-link with each other -- i.e. the enzymes cause the ZP2 to hydrolyse into ZP2f -- making the whole matrix hard and impermeable to sperm . This prevents fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm . The cortical reaction and acrosome reaction are both essential to ensure that only one sperm will fertilize an egg . </P> <H2> Fusion ( edit ) </H2> Fertilization and implantation in humans . <P> After the sperm enters the cytoplasm of the oocyte ( also called ovocyte ) , the tail and the outer coating of the sperm disintegrate and the cortical reaction takes place , preventing other sperm from fertilizing the same egg . The oocyte now undergoes its second meiotic division producing the haploid ovum and releasing a polar body . The sperm nucleus then fuses with the ovum , enabling fusion of their genetic material . </P> <H3> Cell membranes ( edit ) </H3> <P> The fusion of cell membranes of the secondary oocyte and sperm takes place . </P> <H3> Transformations ( edit ) </H3> <P> In preparation for the fusion of their genetic material both the oocyte and the sperm undergo transformations as a reaction to the fusion of cell membranes . </P> <P> The oocyte completes its second meiotic division . This results in a mature ovum . The nucleus of the oocyte is called a pronucleus in this process , to distinguish it from the nuclei that are the result of fertilization . </P> <P> The sperm 's tail and mitochondria degenerate with the formation of the male pronucleus . This is why all mitochondria in humans are of maternal origin . Still , a considerable amount of RNA from the sperm is delivered to the resulting embryo and likely influences embryo development and the phenotype of the offspring . </P> <H3> Replication ( edit ) </H3> <P> The pronuclei migrate toward the center of the oocyte , rapidly replicating their DNA as they do so to prepare the zygote for its first mitotic division . </P> <H3> Mitosis ( edit ) </H3> <P> Usually 23 chromosomes from spermatozoon and 23 chromosomes from egg cell fuse ( half of spermatozoons carry X chromosome and the other half Y chromosome ) . Their membranes dissolve , leaving no barriers between the male and female chromosomes . During this dissolution , a mitotic spindle forms between them . The spindle captures the chromosomes before they disperse in the egg cytoplasm . Upon subsequently undergoing mitosis ( which includes pulling of chromatids towards centrioles in anaphase ) the cell gathers genetic material from the male and female together . Thus , the first mitosis of the union of sperm and oocyte is the actual fusion of their chromosomes . </P> <P> Each of the two daughter cells resulting from that mitosis has one replica of each chromatid that was replicated in the previous stage . Thus , they are genetically identical . </P> <H2> Fertilization age ( edit ) </H2> <P> Fertilization is the event most commonly used to mark the zero point in descriptions of prenatal development of the embryo or fetus . The resultant age is known as fertilization age , fertilizational age , embryonic age , fetal age or ( intrauterine ) developmental ( IUD ) age . </P> <P> Gestational age , in contrast , takes the beginning of the last menstrual period ( LMP ) as the zero point . By convention , gestational age is calculated by adding 14 days to fertilization age and vice versa . In fact , however , fertilization usually occurs within a day of ovulation , which , in turn , occurs on average 14.6 days after the beginning of the preceding menstruation ( LMP ) . There is also considerable variability in this interval , with a 95 % prediction interval of the ovulation of 9 to 20 days after menstruation even for an average woman who has a mean LMP - to - ovulation time of 14.6 . In a reference group representing all women , the 95 % prediction interval of the LMP - to - ovulation is 8.2 to 20.5 days . </P> <P> The average time to birth has been estimated to be 268 days ( 38 weeks and two days ) from ovulation , with a standard deviation of 10 days or coefficient of variation of 3.7 % . </P> <P> Fertilization age is sometimes used postnatally ( after birth ) as well to estimate various risk factors . For example , it is a better predictor than postnatal age for risk of intraventricular hemorrhage in premature babies treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation . </P> <H2> Diseases ( edit ) </H2> <P> Various disorders can arise from defects in the fertilization process . </P> <Ul> <Li> Polyspermy results from multiple sperm fertilizing an egg . </Li> </Ul> <P> However , some researchers have found that in rare pairs of fraternal twins , their origin might have been from the fertilization of one egg cell from the mother and eight sperm cells from the father . This possibility has been investigated by computer simulations of the fertilization process . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Spontaneous conception , the unassisted conception of a subsequent child after prior use of assisted reproductive technology </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Garrison , Fielding .

Sir Humphrey Gilbert 's half - brother Sir Walter Raleigh later gained his brother 's charter from the Queen and subsequently executed the details of the charter through his delegates Ralph Lane and Richard Grenville , Raleigh 's distant cousin . </P> <H2> Raleigh 's charter </H2> A watercolor of the fort in Guyanailla Bay , which is likely similar to the fort constructed on Roanoke <P> On March 25 , 1584 , Queen Elizabeth I granted Raleigh a charter for the colonization of the area of North America . This charter specified that Raleigh needed to establish a colony in North America , or lose his right to colonization . </P> <P> The Queen and Raleigh intended that the venture should provide riches from the New World . The queen 's charter said that Raleigh was supposed to `` discover , search , find out , and view such remote heathen and barbarous Lands , Countries , and territories ... to have , hold , occupy , and enjoy '' . </P> <P> The queen 's charter also said that Raleigh was supposed to establish a base from which to send privateers on raids against the treasure fleets of Spain . The purpose of these raids was to tell Spain that England was ready for war . The original charter basically told Raleigh to establish a military base to counteract the activities of the Spaniards . Raleigh himself never visited North America , although he led expeditions in 1595 and 1617 to South America 's Orinoco River basin in search of the legendary golden city of El Dorado . </P> <H2> First Voyages to Roanoke Island </H2> <P> On April 27 , 1584 , Raleigh dispatched an expedition led by Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe to explore the eastern coast of North America . They arrived on Roanoke Island on July 4 and soon established relations with the local natives , the Secotans and Croatans . Barlowe returned to England with two Croatans named Manteo and Wanchese , who were able to describe the politics and geography of the area to Raleigh . Based on the information given , Raleigh organized a second expedition , to be led by Sir Richard Grenville . </P> Sir Walter Raleigh <P> Grenville 's fleet departed Plymouth on April 9 , 1585 , with five main ships : Tiger ( Grenville 's ) , Roebuck , Red Lion , Elizabeth , and Dorothy . A severe storm off the coast of Portugal separated Tiger from the rest of the fleet . The captains had a contingency plan if they were separated , which was to meet up again in Puerto Rico , and Tiger arrived in the `` Baye of Muskito '' ( Guayanilla Bay ) on May 11 . </P> <P> While waiting for the other ships , Grenville established relations with the resident Spanish while simultaneously engaging in some privateering against them . He also built a fort . Elizabeth arrived soon after the fort 's construction . Grenville eventually tired of waiting for the remaining ships and departed on June 7 . The fort was abandoned , and its location remains unknown . </P> <P> Tiger sailed through Ocracoke Inlet on June 26 , but it struck a shoal , ruining most of the food supplies . The expedition succeeded in repairing the ship and , in early July , reunited with Roebuck and Dorothy , which had arrived in the Outer Banks with Red Lion some weeks previous . Red Lion had dropped off its passengers and left for Newfoundland for privateering . </P> <H3> In the New World </H3> <P> During the initial exploration of the mainland coast and the native settlements , the Europeans blamed the natives of the village of Aquascogoc for stealing a silver cup . As retaliation , the settlers sacked and burned the village . English writer and courtier Richard Hakluyt 's contemporaneous reports also describe this incident . ( Hakluyt 's reports of the first voyage to Roanoke were compiled from accounts by various financial backers , including Sir Walter Raleigh . Hakluyt himself never traveled to the New World . ) </P> <P> Despite this incident and a lack of food , Grenville decided to leave Ralph Lane and 107 men to establish a colony at the north end of Roanoke Island , promising to return in April 1586 with more men and fresh supplies . The group disembarked on August 17 , 1585 , and built a small fort on the island . There are no surviving renderings of the Roanoke fort , but it was likely similar in structure to the one in Guayanilla Bay . Grenville in the Tiger on only his seventh day of sail captured ( after a three - day battle ) a rich Spanish galleon , Santa Maria de San Vicente off Bermuda which he took with him as a prize back to England . </P> <P> As April 1586 passed , there was no sign of Grenville 's relief fleet . Meanwhile , in June , bad blood resulted from the destruction of the village , and this spurred an attack on the fort by the local Native Americans , which the colonists were able to repel . Soon after the attack , Sir Francis Drake was on his way home from a successful raid in the Caribbean , and he stopped at the colony and offered to take the colonists back to England . Several accepted , including metallurgist Joachim Gans . On this return voyage , the Roanoke colonists introduced tobacco , maize , and potatoes to England . The relief fleet arrived shortly after Drake 's departure with the colonists . Finding the colony abandoned , Grenville returned to England with the bulk of his force , leaving behind a small detachment of fifteen men both to maintain an English presence and to protect Raleigh 's claim to Roanoke Island . </P> <H2> Lost Colony </H2> <P> In 1587 , Raleigh dispatched a new group of 115 colonists to establish a colony on Chesapeake Bay . They were led by John White , an artist and friend of Raleigh who had accompanied the previous expedition to Roanoke , and was appointed governor of the 1587 colony . White and Raleigh named 12 assistants to aid in the settlement . They were ordered to stop at Roanoke to pick up the small contingent left there by Grenville the previous year , but when they arrived on July 22 , 1587 , they found nothing except a skeleton that may have been the remains of one of the English garrison . </P> Baptism of Virginia Dare , the first English child born in North America . Lithograph , 1880 <P> When they could find no one , the master pilot Simon Fernandez refused to let the colonists return to the ships , insisting that they establish the new colony on Roanoke . His motives remain unclear , however , and new evidence offered by author Brandon Fullam indicates not only that Fernandez had good reason for his actions , but that the decision to alter the Chesapeake Bay destination had already been agreed to prior to their arrival at Roanoke . </P> <P> White re-established relations with the Croatan and other local tribes , but those with whom Lane had fought previously refused to meet with him . Shortly thereafter , colonist George Howe was killed by a native while searching alone for crabs in Albemarle Sound . </P> <P> The colonists persuaded Governor White to return to England to explain the colony 's desperate situation and ask for help . Left behind were about 115 colonists -- the remaining men and women who had made the Atlantic crossing plus White 's newly born granddaughter Virginia Dare , the first English child born in the Americas . </P> <P> White sailed for England in late 1587 , although crossing the Atlantic at that time of year was a considerable risk . Plans for a relief fleet were delayed first by the captain 's refusal to return during the winter , and then the attack on England of the Spanish Armada and the subsequent Anglo - Spanish War . Every able English ship joined the fight , leaving White without a means to return to Roanoke at the time . In the spring of 1588 , White managed to acquire two small vessels and sailed for Roanoke ; however , his attempt to return was thwarted when the captains of the ships attempted to capture several Spanish ships on the outward - bound voyage ( in order to improve their profits ) . They themselves were captured and their cargo seized . With nothing left to deliver to the colonists , the ships returned to England . </P> <H3> Return to the Lost Colony </H3> Further information : Watts ' West Indies and Virginia expedition The discovery of the word `` Croatoan '' carved onto a stockade board <P> Because of the continuing war with Spain , White was unable to mount another resupply attempt for an additional three years . He finally gained passage on a privateering expedition organised by John Watts and Walter Raleigh . They agreed to stop off at Roanoke on the way back after raiding the Spanish in the Caribbean . White landed on August 18 , 1590 , on his granddaughter 's third birthday , but found the settlement deserted . His men could not find any trace of the 90 men , 17 women , and 11 children , nor was there any sign of a struggle or battle . </P> <P> The only clue was the word `` CROATOAN '' carved into a post of the fence around the village , and the letters C-R-O carved into a nearby tree . All the houses and fortifications had been dismantled , which meant that their departure had not been hurried . Before he had left the colony , White instructed the colonists that , if anything happened to them , they should carve a Maltese cross on a tree nearby , indicating that their absence had been forced . There was no cross , and White took this to mean that they had moved to Croatoan Island ( now known as Hatteras Island ) , but he was unable to conduct a search . A massive storm was forming and his men refused to go any farther ; the next day , they left . </P> <H2> Thomas Harriot </H2> <P> Born in 1560 , Thomas Harriot entered Raleigh 's employment in the early 1580s , after graduating from the University of Oxford . Harriot may have been among the men of Arthur Barlowe 's 1584 expedition of the colony . He trained the members of Raleigh 's first Roanoke expedition in navigational skills and eventually sailed to Roanoke with the second group of settlers , where his skills as a naturalist became particularly important along with those of painter and settlement leader John White . </P> <P> Between their arrival in Roanoke in April 1585 and the July 1586 departure , Harriot and White both conducted detailed studies of the Roanoke area , with Harriot compiling his samples and notes into several notebooks that did not survive the colony 's disappearance . Harriot also wrote descriptions of the surrounding flora and fauna of the area , which survive in his work A Brief and True Report of the New Founde Land of Virginia , written as a report on the colony 's progress to the English government on the request of Raleigh . Viewed by modern historians as propaganda for the colony , this work has become vastly important to Roanoke 's history due to Harriot 's observations on wildlife as well as his depictions of Indian activities at the time of the colony 's disappearance . </P> <P> Harriot reports that relations between the Roanoke Indians and the English settlers were mutually calm and prosperous , contradicting other historical evidence that catalogs the bloody struggles between the Roanoke Indians and both of Raleigh 's commanders , Sir Richard Grenville and his successor , Ralph Lane . Harriot recounts little to none of these accounts in his report to England and does not mention the disorderly state of the colony under either Grenville 's or Lane 's tenure , correctly assuming these facts would prevent Roanoke from gaining more settlers . Harriot 's text did not reach England , or the English press , until 1588 , by which time the fate of the `` Lost Colony '' was sealed in all but name . </P> <H2> Investigations into Roanoke </H2> Reconstructed fortifications at Fort Raleigh National Historic Site <P> Twelve years went by before Raleigh decided to find out what happened to his colony . Led by Samuel Mace , this 1602 expedition differed from previous voyages in that Raleigh bought his own ship and guaranteed the sailors ' wages so that they would not be distracted by privateering . However , Raleigh still hoped to make money from the trip , and Mace 's ship landed in the Outer Banks to gather aromatic woods or plants such as sassafras that would generate a decent profit back in England . By the time they could turn their attention to the colonists , the weather had turned bad and they were forced to return without even making it to Roanoke Island . By this time , having been arrested for treason , Raleigh was unable to send any further missions . </P> <P> There was one final expedition in 1603 led by Bartholomew Gilbert with the intention of finding Roanoke colonists . Their intended destination was Chesapeake Bay , but bad weather forced them to land in an unspecified location near there . The landing team , including Gilbert himself , was killed by a group of Native Americans for unknown reasons on July 29 . The remaining crew were forced to return to England empty - handed . </P> <P> Meanwhile , the Spanish had different reasons for wanting to find the colony . Knowing of Raleigh 's plans to use Roanoke as a base for privateering , they were hoping to destroy it . Moreover , they had been getting mostly inaccurate reports of activities there , and they imagined the colony to be far more successful than it actually was . </P> <P> In 1590 , they found the remnants of the colony purely by accident , but assumed it was only an outlying base of the main settlement , which they believed was in the Chesapeake Bay area ( John White 's intended location ) . But just as the Anglo - Spanish War prevented White from returning in a timely manner , Spanish authorities in the New World could not muster enough support back home for such a venture . </P> <H2> Reports of John Smith and William Strachey </H2> <P> Once the Jamestown settlement was established in 1607 , efforts were undertaken by the English to acquire information from the Powhatan tribe about Roanoke . The first definitive information concerning the fate of the Lost Colony came from Captain John Smith , leader of the Jamestown Colony from 1608 to 1609 . According to chronicler Samuel Purchas , Smith learned from Chief Powhatan that he had personally conducted the slaughter of the Roanoke colonists just prior to the arrival of the Jamestown settlers because they were living with the Chesepians , a tribe living in the eastern portion of the present - day South Hampton Roads sub-region who were related to the Pamlico tribe in Carolina and who refused to merge with the Powhatans . This shocking information was reported to England and by the spring of 1609 , King James and the Royal Council were convinced that Chief Powhatan was responsible for the slaughter of the Lost Colony . </P> <P> The second source of Chief Powhatan 's involvement was William Strachey , Secretary of the Jamestown colony in 1610 -- 11 . Strachey 's The Historie of Travaile Into Virginia Britannia seemed to confirm Smith 's report and provided additional information : the colonists had been living peacefully among a group of natives beyond Powhatan 's domain for more than twenty years when they were massacred . Furthermore , Powhatan himself seemed to have directed the slaughter because of prophecies by his priests that he would be overthrown by people from that area , and he reportedly produced several English - made iron implements to back his claim . </P> <P> The information from these two sources , John Smith and William Strachey , provides the basis for the traditional view that the Lost Colony was slaughtered by Chief Powhatan , and versions of the Powhatan - Lost Colony - slaughter scenario have persisted for more than 400 years . However , no bodies were found and no archaeological evidence has been found to support this claim . </P> <P> Furthermore , recent re-examination of the Smith and Strachey sources advanced by author and researcher Brandon Fullam has suggested that the massacre described by Powhatan was actually of the 15 people left behind by the first Roanoke expedition , leaving the fate of the second colony still unknown . </P> <H2> Hypotheses about the disappearance </H2> <P> </P> <H3> Integration with local tribes </H3> The Francis Nelson ( or Zuniga ) map , c. 1607 <P> As per Smith 's and Strachey 's reports , Dr. David Beers Quinn theorized that the colonists moved north to integrate with the Chesepians that Chief Powhatan claimed to have killed . To make the journey northward , Quinn believed that they used the pinnace and other small boats to transport themselves and their belongings . Naturally , if that were the mode of transportation , the colonists could have gone to live in other locations as well . </P> <P> In her 2000 book Roanoke : Solving the Mystery of the Lost Colony , historian Lee Miller postulated that some of the Lost Colony survivors sought shelter with the Chowanoke , who were attacked by another tribe , identified by the Jamestown Colony as the `` Mandoag '' ( an Algonquian name commonly given to enemy nations ) . The Mandoag are believed to be either the Tuscarora , an Iroquois - speaking tribe , or the Eno , also known as the Wainoke . </P> <P> The so - called `` Zuniga Map '' ( named for Pedro de Zúñiga , the Spanish ambassador to England , who had secured a copy and passed it on to Philip III of Spain ) , drawn about 1607 by the Jamestown settler Francis Nelson , also gives credence to this claim . The map states `` four men clothed that came from roonock '' were living in an Iroquois site on the Neuse . William Strachey wrote that , at the Indian settlements of Peccarecanick and Ochanahoen , there were reportedly two - story houses with stone walls . The Indians supposedly had learned how to build them from the Roanoke settlers . In both cases , as stated above , it is equally possible that these were survivors of Chief Powhatan 's attack on the first Jamestown colonists . </P> <P> There were also reported sightings of European captives at various Indian settlements during the same time period . Strachey wrote in 1612 that four English men , two boys and one girl had been sighted at the Eno settlement of Ritanoc , under the protection of a chief called Eyanoco . Strachey reported that the captives were forced to beat copper and that they had escaped the attack on the other colonists and fled up the Chaonoke river , the present - day Chowan River in Bertie County , North Carolina . </P> <P> John Lawson wrote in his 1709 work A New Voyage to Carolina that the Croatans living on Hatteras Island used to live on Roanoke Island and claimed to have white ancestors : </P> <P> A farther Confirmation of this we have from the Hatteras Indians , who either then lived on Ronoak - Island , or much frequented it . These tell us , that several of their Ancestors were white People , and could talk in a Book , as we do ; the Truth of which is confirm 'd by gray Eyes being found frequently amongst these Indians , and no others . They value themselves extremely for their Affinity to the English , and are ready to do them all friendly Offices . It is probable , that this Settlement miscarry 'd for want of timely Supplies from England ; or thro ' the Treachery of the Natives , for we may reasonably suppose that the English were forced to cohabit with them , for Relief and Conversation ; and that in process of Time , they conform 'd themselves to the Manners of their Indian Relations . </P> <P> From the early 17th century to the middle 18th century , European colonists reported encounters with gray - eyed American Indians who claimed descent from the colonists ( although at least one , a story of a Welsh priest who met a Doeg warrior who spoke the Welsh language , is likely to be a hoax ) . Records from French Huguenots who settled along the Tar River in 1696 tell of meeting Tuscaroras with blond hair and blue eyes not long after their arrival . As Jamestown was the nearest English settlement , and they had no record of being attacked by Tuscarora , the likelihood that the origin of those fair - skinned natives was the Lost Colony is high . </P> <P> Fred Willard and Phillip MacMullan believe that the colonists along with the Croatans relocated to villages along the Alligator River in an area known as `` Beechland '' , slightly inland from Roanoke Island . Archeological remains of settlements have been discovered in the area , including coffins with Christian markings on them where there had been no previous record of a grave site , but their hypothesis is mostly based on oral histories and also lacks any definitive evidence . </P> <P> In the late 1880s , North Carolina state legislator Hamilton McMillan discovered that his `` redbones '' ( those of Indian blood ) neighbors in Robeson County claimed to have been descended from the Roanoke settlers . He also noticed that many of the words in their language had striking similarities to obsolete English words . Furthermore , many of the family names were identical to those listed in Hakluyt 's account of the colony . Thus on February 10 , 1885 , convinced that these were the descendants of the Lost Colony , he helped to pass the `` Croatan bill '' , that officially designated the population around Robeson county as Croatan . Two days later on February 12 , 1885 , the Fayetteville Observer published an article regarding the Robeson people 's origins . This article states : </P> <P> They say that their traditions say that the people we call the Croatan Indians ( though they do not recognize that name as that of a tribe , but only a village , and that they were Tuscaroras ) , were always friendly to the whites ; and finding them destitute and despairing of ever receiving aid from England , persuaded them to leave ( Roanoke Island ) , and go to the mainland ... They gradually drifted away from their original seats , and at length settled in Robeson , about the center of the county ... </P> <P> However , the case was far from settled . A similar legend claims that the now extinct Saponi of Person County , North Carolina , are descended from the English colonists of Roanoke Island . However , no documented evidence exists to link the Saponi to the Roanoke colonists . </P> <P> Other tribes claiming partial descent from surviving Roanoke colonists include the Catawba ( who absorbed the Shakori and Eno people ) , and the Coree and the people who call themselves the Lumbee . Samuel A'Court Ashe was convinced that the colonists had relocated westward to the banks of the Chowan River in Bertie County , and Conway Whittle Sams claimed that after being attacked by Wanchese and Powhatan , the colonists scattered to multiple locations : the Chowan River , and south to the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers . </P> <H3> Other theories </H3> Spanish <P> Another theory is that the Spanish destroyed the colony . Earlier in the century , the Spanish did destroy evidence of the French colony of Fort Charles in coastal South Carolina and then massacred the inhabitants of Fort Caroline , a French colony near present - day Jacksonville , Florida . However , a Spanish attack is unlikely , as the Spanish were still looking for the location of England 's failed colony as late as 1600 , ten years after White discovered that the colony was missing . </P> Dare stones Main article : Dare Stones <P> From 1937 to 1941 , a series of inscribed stones were discovered that were claimed to have been written by Eleanor Dare , mother of Virginia Dare . They told of the travelings of the colonists and their ultimate deaths . Most historians believe that they are a fraud , but there are some today who still believe at least one of the stones to be genuine . </P> Virginia Pars map <P> In May 2011 , Brent Lane of the First Colony Foundation was studying the Virginia Pars Map , which was made by John White during his 1585 visit to Roanoke Island , and noticed two patches where the map had been corrected . The patches are made of paper contemporaneous with that of the map . Lane asked researchers at the British Museum in London , where the map has been kept since 1866 , what might be under the patches , sparking a research investigation . On May 3 , 2012 , at Wilson Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , members of the Foundation and representatives of the museum announced the discovery of `` a large , square - shaped symbol with oddly shaped corners . '' This symbol , presumed to represent a fort , is visible when the map is viewed on a light box . Some scholars speculate that the colonists relocated to that location , on what is now called Salmon Creek in the Bertie County community of Merry Hill . The Scotch Hall Preserve golf course community was planned on the site , but it has not been fully developed . </P> <P> The discovery of new information on the map led to more study of artifacts previously found , as well as additional digs in 2012 and 2014 . </P> <H2> Archaeological evidence </H2> <P> In 1993 , Hurricane Emily caused numerous relics to appear , and David Phelps of East Carolina University later began digging in the area and found evidence the settlers lived with the native people . </P> <P> In 1998 , East Carolina University organized `` The Croatoan Project '' , an archaeological investigation into the events at Roanoke . The excavation team sent to Hatteras Island uncovered what they believed to be a 10 karat ( 42 % ) gold 16th - century English signet ring , gun flints , and two copper farthings ( produced sometime in the 1670s ) at the site of the ancient Croatan capital , 50 miles ( 80 km ) from the old Roanoke Colony . Genealogists were able to trace the lion crest on the signet ring to the Kendall coat of arms , and concluded that the ring most likely belonged to one Master Kendall who is recorded as having lived in the Roanoke Colony from 1585 to 1586 . If this is the case , the ring represents the first material connection between the Roanoke colonists and the Native Americans on Hatteras Island . However , archaeologist David Phelps did not have the ring tested , and Charles Ewen , who continued Phelps ' work after Phelps retired , had the ring tested and found the ring was brass . Ewen announced his findings in April 2017 . Mark Horton of the University of Bristol said he was not convinced that this news proved the ring did not date to the 16th century . </P> <P> It is also believed that the reason for the extreme deficiency in archaeological evidence is due to shoreline erosion . Since all that was found was a rustic looking fort on the north shore , and this location is well - documented and backed up , it is believed that the settlement must have been nearby . The northern shore , between 1851 and 1970 , lost 928 feet ( 283 m ) because of erosion . If in the years leading up to and following the brief life of the settlement at Roanoke , shoreline erosion was following the same trend , it is likely the site of the dwellings is underwater , along with any artifacts or signs of life . Archaeological investigations continue to find tantalizing clues and funding is being sought to continue recent excavations . </P> <H2> Climate factors </H2> <P> In 1998 , a team led by climatologist David W. Stahle , of the University of Arkansas and archaeologist Dennis B. Blanton of the College of William and Mary used tree ring cores from 800 - year - old bald cypresses taken from the Roanoke Island area of North Carolina and the Jamestown area of Virginia to reconstruct precipitation and temperature chronologies . </P> <P> The researchers concluded that the settlers of the Lost Colony landed at Roanoke Island in the summer of the worst growing - season drought in 800 years . `` This drought persisted for 3 years , from 1587 to 1589 , and is the driest 3 - year episode in the entire 800 - year reconstruction , '' the team reported in the journal Science . A map shows that `` the Lost Colony drought affected the entire southeastern United States but was particularly severe in the Tidewater region near Roanoke ( Island ) . '' The authors suggested that the Croatan who were shot and killed by the colonists may have been scavenging the abandoned village for food as a result of the drought . </P> <H2> Lost Colony of Roanoke DNA Project </H2> <P> The Lost Colony of Roanoke DNA Project was founded in 2007 by a group led by Roberta Estes , who owns a private DNA - testing company , in order to solve the mystery of the Lost Colony using historical records , migration patterns , oral histories and DNA testing . The project used Y chromosome , Mitochondrial DNA and Autosomal DNA . As of 2016 , they have not yet been able to positively identify any descendants of the colony . </P> <H2> In popular culture </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

When the feature size becomes smaller and smaller to increase the clock speed , the RC delay plays an increasingly important role . This delay can be reduced by replacing the aluminum conducting wire by copper , thus reducing the resistance ; it can also be reduced by changing the interlayer dielectric ( typically silicon dioxide ) to low - dielectric - constant materials , thus reducing the capacitance . </P> <P> The typical digital propagation delay of a resistive wire is about half of R times C ; since both R and C are proportional to wire length , the delay scales as the square of wire length . Charge spreads by diffusion in such a wire , as explained by Lord Kelvin in the mid nineteenth century . Until Heaviside discovered that Maxwell 's equations imply wave propagation when sufficient inductance is in the circuit , this square diffusion relationship was thought to provide a fundamental limit to the improvement of long - distance telegraph cables . That old analysis was superseded in the telegraph domain , but remains relevant for long on - chip interconnects . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Cutoff frequency and frequency response </Li> <Li> Emphasis , preemphasis , deemphasis </Li> <Li> Exponential decay </Li> <Li> Filter ( signal processing ) and transfer function </Li> <Li> High - pass filter , low - pass filter , band - pass filter </Li> <Li> RL circuit , and RLC circuit </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/capdis.html </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Andrew Gray ( 1908 ) .

Juliette was characterized as an up - and - coming country - pop diva and rival of series co-lead Rayna Jaymes , a fading country star played by Connie Britton . Although best known as an actress , Panettiere had a brief music career , recording songs for several films between 2004 and 2007 and planning to release an album . Though she co-wrote and recorded some songs for it , it was never completed or released . She later explained : `` I quit after about four or five years of recording , and I said this is not me . But I said that if I was ever going to do music again , I would do country music , and for this ( Nashville ) to come along and to get both of the things I love ( acting and country music ) combined in one show , it 's a dream come true . '' </P> <P> Panettiere has denied media reports that her character resembles Taylor Swift , ( who was also born in 1989 ) and states that Juliette is instead based on herself -- a young woman in the entertainment industry -- and Carrie Underwood . She was attracted to the character because she was `` so multidimensional '' and because she wanted to `` break away from her character in Heroes . '' </P> <P> Panettiere has revealed that she was not the first choice to play the role , as the producers were not sure she would be able to render Juliette vulnerable enough to be likeable . However , after Panettiere was cast , the writers re-wrote Juliette , who was originally seen as a supporting character to Rayna James ' series lead , to be a co-lead alongside her . </P> <H2> Storylines ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This article describes a work or element of fiction in a primarily in - universe style .

At the age of 16 in Alabama , Juliette was discovered by manager Glenn Goodman at a county fair performing and signed with him . From there she moved to Nashville , TN and signed with Edgehill Republic Entertainment Records in 2010 . An instant success her debut album `` Juliette '' reached the number one position on the billboard country charts and went multi-platinum . Her sophomore record `` All My Angels '' was an even bigger success with the tween demographics reaching number one on both the Billboard Country Chart & the Billboard 200 Chart . During recording for her follow up 3rd album , Juliette was charged with petty theft after a fan recorded her stealing a small bottle of nail polish from a local drug store . Along with this it came too light that her mother was a drug addict criminal after her mother was arrested for possession . Juliette got back on track , releasing a co-written instant hit song with country legend , Rayna Jaymes titled `` Wrong Song '' . Juliette ultimately became engaged to rookie football player , Sean Butler . The couple called it quits after Juliette left Sean at the altar and began her world tour `` Red Lips White Lies '' with Rayna Jaymes . It was later revealed that Juliette and Sean had eloped a few days before their ceremony , the marriage was ultimately annulled with Barnes admitting guilt of misrepresenting herself . Months later Juliette was in the headlines again with her mothers untimely death after a drug fueled murder - suicide with her sober companion Dante Reeves . </P> <P> Her follow up record `` Inside The Dream '' came out in early 2014 and was successful , ( but a moderate success compared to her previous records ) as she began to mature her sound . It was kept from the top spot on the charts by Rayna Jaymes ' `` The Best OF '' released after her fatal car accident which left her in a coma for two weeks . Barnes was then eventually asked to join the Grand Ole Opry as a member by Rayna James in later 2014 . Barnes continued to mature her sound after this and began to garner an adult fan base as she rebranded her `` Red Lips And White Lies '' Tour after Rayna quit to spend time with her daughters , and embarked on her `` Inside The Dream '' North American Tour with Layla Grant and Will Lexington as her opening acts . During this time though Barnes got black listed from country radio , & country music fans after news broke of her affair with mogul , Charles Wentworth & after she stated `` There Is No God '' to a crowd of protestors outside of her concert arena . Fans immediately turned on the country singer holding burnings of her albums , along with having promoters cancel her concerts after bomb threats were sent to the locations . It was later proven to be by reality star / upcoming country singer Layla Grant that the religious protesters had antagonized Barnes deeming that she was a sinner who was going to burn in hell with her mother . Grant then cleared the air that Barnes actually said `` There Is No God , who would listen to a crackpot like you '' . Unfortunately it took radio and fans a long time to move forward from this . Barnes then fueled the flames refusing to be forced to apologize for something she had n't done , by performing her new song `` Do n't Put Dirt On My Grave Just Yet '' , ( co-written with Avery Barkley ) during her induction to the Grand Ole Opry . This decision led to Edgehill Republic Entertainment Records dropping her immediately following her performance and to stores no longer carrying her physical albums . Barnes , though black listed , was offered recording contracts from major labels outside of Nashville such as Capital , Interscope , and Warner Brothers to name a few . Barnes decided not too sign with any large label in order to maintain her musical freedom and not be forced to make a pop record . Ultimately despite an offer from Edgehill to resign her offering her an imprint and a $250,000 producing deal for her boyfriend Avery , she signed with Country Legend Rayna Jaymes ' label Highway 65 Records , Though no music was released during her year on this label . </P> <P> During this year Barnes got married to boyfriend Avery Barkley , and the couple had their first child , a daughter named Cadence . Barnes also made her film debut playing the role of country icon , Patsy Cline along with actor Noah West in the film `` Shenandoah Girl '' . Barnes was then nominated for an Oscar award as Best Actress for her performance in the film . After Barnes departed from Highway 65 Records , she signed with Country singer Luke Wheeler 's label `` Wheelin ' Dealin ' Records '' . During this time she fired longtime on and off manager , Glenn Goodman and hired former CEO of Edgehill Republic Entertainment Records Jeff Fordham as her manager . Through Wheeler 's label she then released her critical & commercially successful album 2016 's `` Unleashed '' ( that she recorded while under Highway 65 Records before being bought out of her contract ) which debuted at # 1 on both Billboards 200 chart and Billboards Country Chart . Barnes then joined Luke Wheeler 's `` Never Back Down Tour '' and continued on it as an opening act until she took a break after attacking a fan in the lobby of a hotel in Atlanta and the death of her manager via suicide the following day . Barnes then kept a low profile only being heard from when the announcement of her divorce from Avery Barkley was made public . Barnes continued to keep a low profile until it was announced she was going to star in her 2nd picture following her raved performance in `` Shenandoah Girl '' , a Stephen Spielberg film . But before filming began during its press tour it was revealed that Barnes had been keeping a low profile as she had been in rehab for the past 3 months dealing with emotional issues and her battle with postpartum depression which she stated cost her her relationship with her daughter , and her marriage . </P> <P> Following more down time , Barnes was ultimately in a deadly Plane crash after leaving the 2016 Oscars in order to reunite with her estranged husband and daughter .

Juliette , being young , beautiful and ambitious , had no qualms about leaving her dysfunctional home life and her drug - addicted mother behind . She quickly rose to become Edgehill Republic Records biggest star , a pop - country sensation , with legions of young teenage fans and sell out tours . Despite Juliette 's singing talent being questioned by several characters , including Rayna Jaymes , she shows not only raw talent but has also proven herself to be a capable songwriter and works with talented musicians such as Deacon Clayborne and Avery Barkley . Juliette and Rayna , however , have two things in common , both of them had bad parents and both of them left home when they were 16 to become famous country music stars . </P> <P> Juliette is initially played as a demanding , arrogant diva , but there is another side to her . The main reason why she was the main antagonist in the series . She is a girl who has fought for everything she has and is prepared to do anything to get to the top . However , her hard exterior shields a world of pain that she rarely lets people see . She has no friends , no - one she can truly turn to , and she has seen the worst of people growing up , which has left her unable to connect with people emotionally . As a result , she shows a desperate desire to be loved by anyone who shows her the slightest bit of affection , such as when she falls in love with her mother 's drug counselor . </P> <H3> Season 1 ( edit ) </H3> <P> When the series begins , Juliette is a fast - rising star , with the potential to topple Queen of Country , Rayna Jaymes . Juliette sees Rayna as a has - been , while Rayna sees Juliette as a talentless bimbo . To the public , Juliette is a sweet - natured , fun loving , glamorous bubble - gum country star . Behind the scenes , however , Juliette is neither sweet natured or fun , but rather a cold - hearted , demanding , spoiled young woman who wants what she wants when she wants it , and what she wants is to be the Queen of Country . </P> <P> Despite a string of number ones and sell - out tours , Juliette struggles to be taken seriously , having her vocals auto - tuned and her videos being cheesy and cliched , she decides to work with Deacon Clayborne and when she writes with him , he is the first one to recognize her potential as a songwriter . </P> <P> The rivalry between her and Rayna comes to a head when Rayna is promoted from an opening act to co-touring with Juliette and their management suggest they write a song together . Rayna tells Juliette a few home truths about her talent and how her diva - like behavior will be the end of her . This upsets Juliette , however when Deacon shows Rayna the lyrics Juliette has written , Rayna begrudgingly admits she may have been wrong . They finally admit their mutual dislike for each other however manage to finish a song together called `` Wrong Song '' which goes straight to number one . The two are forced to admit a respect for one another despite their continuing dislike . </P> <P> In her personal life , Juliette is set up on a date by a famous football player for the Tennessee Titans named Sean Butler , as her management thinks it will be good press . Juliette finds him sweet , especially when he reveals his intentions to remain a virgin until marriage , a first for Juliette who has only met men who want her for something . However Juliette is looked on with scorn by Sean 's family , especially his mother , who thinks Juliette is trash , which brings out Juliette 's vindictive side and she seduces Sean which leads to a rather hasty marriage . However Juliette realises Sean is a genuinely good person and that she would just end up hurting him when he does n't deserve to be , so she agrees to an annulment . </P> <P> Juliette 's life is further complicated when her drug - addicted mother , Jolene , comes back into her life . All her life , Juliette remembers her irresponsible mother letting her down and losing her every time to drugs with Juliette having to clean up after her and often being on the receiving end of her mother 's drug fuelled violence . However once again she ends up helping her mother , paying for her rehab and eventually falling for her mother 's drug counsellor Dante . No one trusts Dante , who swiftly begins to take over Juliette 's life , her finances and her career , but Juliette is so blindly in love with him she ignores everyone . In the end , everyone is proved right as Dante flees with a chunk of Juliette 's money and also tries to blackmail her out of $10 million with a sex tape he has of the two of them . </P> <P> Juliette refuses to give into his demands and instead issues a statement confessing her role in the tape and how it was released without her permission which garners her respect . However Jolene , finally deciding to help her daughter after years of letting her down , murders Dante , destroys the tape and then kills herself with a drug overdose , devastating Juliette . </P> <H3> Season 2 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Juliette is introduced to Edgehill 's new CEO , Jeff Fordham , and Layla Grant , who rose to fame after being the runner - up in a singing competition .

'' Reviewing each episode of the series for The A.V. Club , Gwen Ihnat has come to regard Juliette as the series ' lead character , and has consistently praised Panettiere for her performances , particularly for playing Juliette as `` domineering , manipulative , in denial , and finally , achingly vulnerable ... ( rising ) from a caricature to become one of the most interesting parts of the show . '' She later noted that `` every single week , Hayden Panettiere is the greatest thing about this show . '' </P> <P> Deena Shanker of Salon has said that Panettiere 's portrayal of Juliette has evolved to the point where she is a `` feminist role model '' . Erin Carlson of The Hollywood Reporter has quipped that Panettiere should win the Michael Emerson prize for `` Humanizing Terrible Characters on Network TV '' after accomplishing what she felt the cast of Girls had not : rendering a `` bitchy '' character to be likeable and the series ' `` best '' , giving her `` purpose , drive , grit and backbone '' . </P> <H3> Awards ( edit ) </H3> <P> Panettiere has been nominated for numerous awards for her role as Juliette : for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress -- Television Series Drama in 2013 and 2014 , a Satellite Award for Best Actress -- Television Series Drama in 2012 , a Teen Choice Award for Television Actress : Drama in 2013 and 2015 , a Prism Award for Female Performance in a Drama Series Multi-Episode Storyline in 2014 , and a Critics ' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2016 . </P> <H2> Album Track listing ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Thicker Than Water ( 2018 ) ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Writer ( s ) </Th> <Th> Producer ( s ) </Th> <Th> Length </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 . </Td> <Td> `` Water Rising '' </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Brett </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Brett </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> 3 : 43 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2 . </Td> <Td> `` Is There Anybody Out There ?

Regulations from the crown were met with fierce opposition from the colonists . After lobbies and petitions proved ineffective , the colonists turned to boycotting imported English goods . Boycotting proved to be successful in crippling British trade . After the first colonial boycott in 1765 , Parliament overturned the Sugar and Stamp Acts , and after a second boycott in 1768 Parliament overturned all of the Townshend duties except for the tax on tea . The colonists persisted , and the American boycott on tea ultimately culminated in the Boston Tea Party of 1773 . Despite the Revolution 's widespread association with the colonists ' aversion to higher taxes , it has been claimed that the colonists actually paid far less tax compared to their British counterparts . </P> <H3> British isolation tactics ( edit ) </H3> <P> British efforts to weaken the colonies included isolating their economy from the rest of the world by cutting off trade . With a navy that was many times more powerful than its American counterpart , the English had complete control over the American ports . The British took control of major port cities along the colonial east coast , and as a result British warships were able to drastically reduce the number of ships that could successfully travel from the colonies . Consequently , the U.S. saw a fall in exported goods due to the relentless British blockade . Furthermore , England 's naval strength was great enough to intimidate other nations and scare them away from exporting goods to the colonies , so smuggled and inexpensive imports became costly and rare . </P> <H3> The American response ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Continental Army under the direction of George Washington sought to engage in a war of attrition . Because the fight was on colonial soil , Washington aimed to take advantage of the lack of trade with Great Britain by cutting them off from necessary resources , hoping that eventually the redcoat army in North America would grow sick and tired . Under the Articles of Confederation , however , the Continental Congress did not have the power to impose taxes or regulate commerce in the colonies , and thus could not generate the sufficient funds for a war of attrition . </P> <P> To solve this problem , the Continental Congress sent diplomats including Benjamin Franklin to Europe in search of foreign support for the American cause . For the first two years of war , the colonists received secretive private and public loans from the French , who held a lingering resentment for the British after the Seven Years ' War . After the British defeat at Saratoga , however , foreign support for the Continental Army increased , and in 1778 the colonies signed a treaty with France , officially bringing them into the war with England . By the end of the war , the colonies had received loans from several different European nations , including significant contribution from France , Spain and the Netherlands . In addition , the colonies received much private funding , most notably from the Marquis de Lafayette and the Baron of Kalb , both Frenchmen . This funding ultimately enabled them to fight the war of attrition that General Washington hoped for . </P> <H3> The American Revolution effect on Great Britain ( edit ) </H3> French warships during the American Revolutionary War . <P> Because the French possessed a powerful navy , their entrance into the war weakened the British blockade on colonial ports and further cut off the British army from its Atlantic supply route . The British forces recognized that they would not last long without shipping in supplies , so in retaliation , the British redeployed some of their forces to the French Caribbean . Their hope was to capture French sugar islands and cut the French financial supply line . The new war in the Caribbean added to England 's already large financial costs , yet unlike the colonies , the British were not successful in their attempts to garner foreign loans or armaments . Without economic assistance from other nations , the financial strain on Parliament and British taxpayers became increasingly burdensome , and ultimately had a hand in wearing down the British forces and ending the war for independence . </P> <H3> American financing ( edit ) </H3> <P> As the war progressed , the Americans ' deteriorating financial stability quickly became Britain 's greatest asset . Because it did not possess the power to tax the colonists , the Continental Congress printed money at a rapid rate to fund the army 's expenses and pay off its loans from foreign nations . As a result , the colonies experienced severe inflation and depreciation of the Continental dollar . The colonists also had great difficulty in financing a wartime effort against the British southern campaign , not effectively halting the British destruction until the battle of Yorktown in 1781 . When war ended in 1783 , American negotiations , monetary policies and government restructuring all contributed to paying off the American national debt . </P> <H2> Belligerents ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Great Britain ( edit ) </H3> <P> The American Revolutionary War took a heavy toll on Great Britain . The average cost for the war was £ 12 million a year . The British ended the war with a national debt of £ 250 million , which generated a yearly interest of over £ 9.5 million . This debt piled on to the already outstanding debt from the Seven Years ' War . Taxes on the British population increased over the years and duties on some items such as glass and lead were also added , the average tax for the British public being four shillings in every pound . Furthermore , the Royal Navy was not able to ' rule the waves ' as it had done in the Seven Years ' War . </P> <P> Great Britain 's trade with the thirteen American colonies fell apart once the American Revolution started , causing British businessmen , especially from the tobacco industry , to suffer . Income from the sale of woolen and metal products dropped sharply and export markets dried up . British merchant sailors also felt the pinch : it is estimated that 3,386 British merchant ships were seized by enemy forces during the war . However , Royal Navy warships did make up these losses somewhat , due to their own privateering efforts on enemy shipping , particularly Spanish and French merchant ships . </P> <H3> France ( edit ) </H3> <P> During the war , France shouldered a financial burden similar to that of Great Britain , as debt from the American Revolutionary War was piled upon already existing debts from the Seven Years ' War . The French spent 1.3 billion livres on war costs . When the war ended , France had accumulated a debt of 3,315.1 million livres , a fortune at the time . </P> <P> The debt caused major economic and political problems for France , and , as the country struggled to pay its debts , eventually led to the Financial Crisis of 1786 and the French Revolution in 1789 . </P> <H3> Spain ( edit ) </H3> <P> Spain 's economic losses were not as great as those of the other belligerents in the American Revolutionary War . This was because Spain paid off her debts quickly and efficiently . However , Spain had nearly doubled her military spending during the war , from 454 million reales in 1778 to over 700 million reales in 1779 . Spain 's revenue loss was similar to Britain 's , since she lost a lot of income from her American colonies due the war . To make up for the shortfall , Spanish governors introduced higher tax rates in the South American colonies , with little success . Spain 's next move was to issue royal bonds to her colonies , also with limited success . Finally , in 1782 the first national bank of Spain -- the Banco San Carlo -- was created to improve and centralize the economic situation . </P> <H3> United States of America ( edit ) </H3> <P> For more details on the impact on the United States , see Economic history of the US . </P> <P> The thirteen American states flourished economically at the beginning of the war . The colonies could trade freely with the West Indies and other European nations , instead of just Britain . Due to the abolition of the British Navigation Acts , American merchants could now transport their goods in European and American ships rather than only British ships . British taxes on expensive wares such as tea , glass , lead and paper were forfeit , and other taxes became cheaper . Plus , American privateering raids on British merchant ships provided more wealth for the Continental Army . </P> <P> As the war went on however , America 's economic prosperity began to fall . British warships began to prey on American shipping , and the increasing upkeep costs of the Continental Army meant that wealth from merchant ships decreased . As cashflow declined , the United States of America had to rely on European loans to maintain the war effort ; France , Spain and the Netherlands lent the United States over $10 million during the war , causing major debt problems for the fledgling nation . Coin circulation had also begun to wane . Because of this , the United States began to print paper money and bills of credit to raise income . This proved unsuccessful , inflation skyrocketed , and the new paper money 's value diminished . A popular saying circulated the colonies because of this : anything of little value became `` not worth a continental . '' </P> <P> According to a 2010 Congressional Research Service report on the `` Costs of Major U.S. Wars '' , the Revolution cost the United States the 2011 equivalent of $2.4 billion . </P> Inflation ( edit ) <P> By 1780 , the United States Congress had issued over $400 million in paper money to troops . Eventually , Congress tried to stop the inflation by imposing economic reforms . These failed , and only further devalued the American currency . There is , however , some disagreement over the amount of currency issued . Between 1775 and 1783 the colonies experienced an average annual inflation rate of approximately 4.3 % . The rate of inflation peaked at 29.78 % in 1778 . Numerous food riots were recorded as discontent grew over rapidly rising prices . The destruction of property and the continued issuing of Continentals by the Congress was another cause of currency devaluation . In addition , counterfeiting of American dollars was carried out by the British Government as an intentional means of sabotaging the war effort . </P> <P> Late in the war , Congress asked individual colonies to equip their own troops , and pay upkeep for their own soldiers in the Continental Army . When the war ended , the United States had spent $37 million at the national level and $114 million at the state level . The United States finally solved its debt problems in the 1790s when Alexander Hamilton founded the First Bank of the United States in order to pay off war debts and establish good national credit . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Notes ( edit ) </H3> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Baack , 2001 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Baack , 2001 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Ferguson , p. 85 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Baack , 2001 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Economic Conditions During the War .

Approximately the size of a domestic chicken , kiwi are by far the smallest living ratites ( which also consist of ostriches , emus , rheas , and cassowaries ) , and lay the largest egg in relation to their body size of any species of bird in the world . </P> <P> DNA sequence comparisons have yielded the surprising conclusion that kiwi are much more closely related to the extinct Malagasy elephant birds than to the moa with which they shared New Zealand . There are five recognised species , two of which are currently endangered , another two of which are vulnerable , and one of which is near - threatened . All species have been negatively affected by historic deforestation but currently the remaining large areas of their forest habitat are well protected in reserves and national parks . At present , the greatest threat to their survival is predation by invasive mammalian predators . </P> <P> The kiwi is a national symbol of New Zealand , and the association is so strong that the term Kiwi is used internationally as the colloquial demonym for New Zealanders . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Etymology </Li> <Li> 2 Taxonomy and systematics <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Species </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Description </Li> <Li> 4 Behaviour and ecology </Li> <Li> 5 Status and conservation <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Sanctuaries </Li> <Li> 5.2 Operation `` Nest Egg '' </Li> <Li> 5.3 1080 poison </Li> <Li> 5.4 Threats </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Relationship to humans <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Scientific documentation </Li> <Li> 6.2 Zoos </Li> <Li> 6.3 As a national symbol </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References <Ul> <Li> 8.1 Notes </Li> <Li> 8.2 Further reading </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Etymology </H2> <P> The Māori language word kiwi ( / ˈkiːwiː / KEE - wee ) is generally accepted to be `` of imitative origin '' from the call . However , some linguists derive the word from Proto - Nuclear Polynesian * kiwi , which refers to Numenius tahitiensis , the bristle - thighed curlew , a migratory bird that winters in the tropical Pacific islands . With its long decurved bill and brown body , the curlew resembles the kiwi . So when the first Polynesian settlers arrived , they may have applied the word kiwi to the new - found bird . The genus name Apteryx is derived from Ancient Greek `` without wing '' : a - , `` without '' or `` not '' ; pterux , `` wing '' . </P> <P> The name is usually uncapitalised , with the plural either the anglicised `` kiwis '' or , consistent with the Māori language , appearing as `` kiwi '' without an `` - s '' . </P> <H2> Taxonomy and systematics </H2> Life restoration of the proto - kiwi Proapteryx micromeros . Clockwise from left : brown kiwi ( Apteryx australis ) , little spotted kiwi ( Apteryx owenii ) and great spotted kiwi ( Apteryx haastii ) at Auckland War Memorial Museum <P> Although it was long presumed that the kiwi was closely related to the other New Zealand ratites , the moa , recent DNA studies have identified its closest relative as the extinct elephant bird of Madagascar , and among extant ratites , the kiwi is more closely related to the emu and the cassowaries than to the moa . </P> <P> Research published in 2013 on an extinct genus , Proapteryx , known from the Miocene deposits of the Saint Bathans Fauna , found that it was smaller and probably capable of flight , supporting the hypothesis that the ancestor of the kiwi reached New Zealand independently from moas , which were already large and flightless by the time kiwi appeared . </P> <H3> Species </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

It has grey - brown plumage with lighter bands . The female lays just one egg , which both parents then incubate . The population is estimated to be over 20,000 , distributed through the more mountainous parts of northwest Nelson , the northern West Coast , and the Southern Alps . </Li> <Li> The small little spotted kiwi , Apteryx owenii is unable to withstand predation by introduced pigs , stoats and cats , which have led to its extinction on the mainland . About 1350 remain on Kapiti Island . It has been introduced to other predator - free islands and appears to be becoming established with about 50 ' Little Spots ' on each island . A docile bird the size of a bantam , it stands 25 cm ( 9.8 in ) high and the female weighs 1.3 kg ( 2.9 lb ) . She lays one egg , which is incubated by the male . </Li> <Li> The Okarito kiwi , also known as the rowi or Okarito brown kiwi , Apteryx rowi , first identified as a new species in 1994 , is slightly smaller , with a greyish tinge to the plumage and sometimes white facial feathers . Females lay as many as three eggs in a season , each one in a different nest . Male and female both incubate . The distribution of these kiwi is limited to a small area on the west coast of the South Island of New Zealand . However , studies of ancient DNA have revealed that , in prehuman times , it was far more widespread up the west coast of the South Island and was present in the lower half of the North Island , where it was the only kiwi species detected . </Li> <Li> The southern brown kiwi , Tokoeka , or Common kiwi , Apteryx australis , is a relatively common species of kiwi , known from south and west parts of the South Island , that occurs at most elevations . It is approximately the size of the great spotted kiwi and is similar in appearance to the brown kiwi , but its plumage is lighter in colour . Ancient DNA studies have shown that , in prehuman times , the distribution of this species included the east coast of South Island . There are several subspecies of the Tokoeka recognised : <Ul> <Li> The Stewart Island southern brown kiwi , Apteryx australis lawryi , is a subspecies of Tokoeka from Stewart Island / Rakiura . </Li> <Li> The Northern Fiordland southern brown kiwi ( Apteryx australis ? ) and Southern Fiordland tokoeka ( Apteryx australis ? ) live in the remote southwest part of the South Island known as Fiordland . These sub-species of tokoeka are relatively common and are nearly 40 cm ( 16 in ) tall . </Li> <Li> The Haast southern brown kiwi , Haast tokoeka , Apteryx australis ' Haast ' , is the rarest subspecies of kiwi with only about 300 individuals . It was identified as a distinct form in 1993 . It occurs only in a restricted area in the South Island 's Haast Range of the Southern Alps at an altitude of 1,500 m ( 4,900 ft ) . This form is distinguished by a more strongly downcurved bill and more rufous plumage . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> The North Island brown kiwi , Apteryx mantelli or Apteryx australis before 2000 ( and still in some sources ) , is widespread in the northern two - thirds of the North Island and , with about 35,000 remaining , is the most common kiwi . Females stand about 40 cm ( 16 in ) high and weigh about 2.8 kg ( 6.2 lb ) , the males about 2.2 kg ( 4.9 lb ) . The North Island brown has demonstrated a remarkable resilience : it adapts to a wide range of habitats , even non-native forests and some farmland . The plumage is streaky red - brown and spiky . The female usually lays two eggs , which are incubated by the male . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Description </H2> <P> Their adaptation to a terrestrial life is extensive : like all the other ratites ( ostrich , emu , rhea and cassowary ) , they have no keel on the sternum to anchor wing muscles . The vestigial wings are so small that they are invisible under the bristly , hair - like , two - branched feathers . While most adult birds have bones with hollow insides to minimise weight and make flight practicable , kiwi have marrow , like mammals and the young of other birds . With no constraints on weight due to flight requirements , brown kiwi females carry and lay a single egg that may weigh as much as 450 g ( 16 oz ) . Like most other ratites , they have no uropygial gland ( preen gland ) . Their bill is long , pliable and sensitive to touch , and their eyes have a reduced pecten . Their feathers lack barbules and aftershafts , and they have large vibrissae around the gape . They have 13 flight feathers , no tail and a small pygostyle . Their gizzard is weak and their caecum is long and narrow . </P> <P> The eye of the kiwi is the smallest relative to body mass in all avian species resulting in the smallest visual field as well . The eye has small specializations for its nocturnal lifestyle but relies on its other senses more heavily ( auditory , olfactory , and somatosensory system ) . The sight of the kiwi is so underdeveloped that blind specimens have been observed in nature showing how little they rely on sight for survival and foraging . In an experiment , it was observed that one - third of a population of A. rowi in New Zealand under no environmental stress had ocular lesions in one or both eyes . The same experiment examined three specific specimens that showed complete blindness and found them to be in good physical standing outside of ocular abnormalities . </P> <P> Unlike virtually every other palaeognath , which are generally small - brained by bird standards , kiwi have proportionally large encephalisation quotients . Hemisphere proportions are even similar to those of parrots and songbirds , though there is no evidence of similarly complex behaviour . </P> <H2> Behaviour and ecology </H2> Relative size of the egg <P> Before the arrival of humans in the 13th century or earlier , New Zealand 's only endemic mammals were three species of bat , and the ecological niches that in other parts of the world were filled by creatures as diverse as horses , wolves and mice were taken up by birds ( and , to a lesser extent , reptiles , insects and gastropods ) . </P> <P> Kiwi are shy and usually nocturnal . Their mostly nocturnal habits may be a result of habitat intrusion by predators , including humans . In areas of New Zealand where introduced predators have been removed , such as sanctuaries , kiwi are often seen in daylight . They prefer subtropical and temperate podocarp and beech forests , but they are being forced to adapt to different habitat , such as sub-alpine scrub , tussock grassland , and the mountains . Kiwi have a highly developed sense of smell , unusual in a bird , and are the only birds with nostrils at the end of their long beaks . Kiwi eat small invertebrates , seeds , grubs , and many varieties of worms . They also may eat fruit , small crayfish , eels and amphibians . Because their nostrils are located at the end of their long beaks , kiwi can locate insects and worms underground using their keen sense of smell , without actually seeing or feeling them . This sense of smell is due to a highly developed olfactory chamber and surrounding regions . It is a common belief that the kiwi relies solely on its sense of smell to catch prey but this has not been scientifically observed . Lab experiments have suggested that A. australis can rely on olfaction alone but is not consistent under natural conditions . Instead , the kiwi may rely on auditory and / or vibrotactile cues . </P> <P> Once bonded , a male and female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple . During the mating season , June to March , the pair call to each other at night , and meet in the nesting burrow every three days . These relationships may last for up to 20 years . They are unusual among other birds in that , along with some raptors , they have a functioning pair of ovaries . ( In most birds and in platypuses , the right ovary never matures , so that only the left is functional . ) Kiwi eggs can weigh up to one - quarter the weight of the female . Usually , only one egg is laid per season . The kiwi lays the biggest egg in proportion to its size of any bird in the world , so even though the kiwi is about the size of a domestic chicken , it is able to lay eggs that are about six times the size of a chicken 's egg . The eggs are smooth in texture , and are ivory or greenish white . The male incubates the egg , except for the great spotted kiwi , A. haastii , in which both parents are involved . The incubation period is 63 -- 92 days . Producing the huge egg places significant physiological stress on the female ; for the thirty days it takes to grow the fully developed egg , the female must eat three times her normal amount of food . Two to three days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for her stomach and she is forced to fast . </P> <P> Lice in the genus Apterygon and in the subgenus Rallicola ( Aptericola ) are exclusively ectoparasites of kiwi species . </P> <H2> Status and Conservation </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

( September 2013 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Nationwide studies show that , on average , only five percent of kiwi chicks survive to adulthood . However , in areas under active pest management , survival rates for North Island brown kiwi can be far higher . For example , prior to a joint 1080 poison operation undertaken by DOC and the Animal Health Board in Tongariro Forest in 2006 , 32 kiwi chicks were radio - tagged. 57 % of the radio - tagged chicks survived to adulthood . Thanks to ongoing pest control , the adult kiwi population at Tongariro has almost doubled since 1998 . </P> <H3> Sanctuaries </H3> <P> In 2000 , the Department of Conservation set up five kiwi sanctuaries focused on developing methods to protect kiwi and to increase their numbers . </P> <Dl> <Dd> There are three kiwi sanctuaries in the North Island : <Ul> <Li> Whangarei Kiwi Sanctuary ( for Northland brown kiwi ) </Li> <Li> Moehau Kiwi Sanctuary on the Coromandel Peninsula ( Coromandel brown kiwi ) </Li> <Li> Tongariro Kiwi Sanctuary near Taupo ( western brown kiwi ) </Li> </Ul> </Dd> <Dd> and two in the South Island : <Ul> <Li> Okarito Kiwi Sanctuary ( Okarito kiwi ) </Li> <Li> Haast Kiwi Sanctuary ( Haast tokoeka ) </Li> </Ul> </Dd> </Dl> <P> A number of other mainland conservation islands and fenced sanctuaries have significant populations of kiwi , including : </P> <Ul> <Li> Zealandia fenced sanctuary in Wellington ( little spotted kiwi ) </Li> <Li> Maungatautari Restoration Project in Waikato ( brown kiwi ) </Li> <Li> Bushy Park Forest Reserve near Kai Iwi , Whanganui ( brown kiwi ) </Li> <Li> Otanewainuku Forest in the Bay of Plenty ( brown kiwi ) </Li> <Li> Hurunui Mainland Island , south branch , Hurunui River , North Canterbury ( great spotted kiwi ) </Li> </Ul> <P> North island brown kiwi were introduced to the Cape Sanctuary in Hawke 's Bay between 2008 and 2011 , which in turn provided captive - raised chicks that were released back into Maungataniwha Native Forest . </P> <H3> Operation `` Nest egg '' </H3> <P> Operation Nest Egg is a programme run by the BNZ Save the Kiwi Trust -- a partnership between the Bank of New Zealand , the Department of Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society . Kiwi eggs and chicks are removed from the wild and hatched and / or raised in captivity until big enough to fend for themselves -- usually when they weigh around 1200 grams ( 42 ounces ) . They are then returned to the wild . An Operation Nest Egg bird has a 65 % chance of surviving to adulthood -- compared to just 5 % for wild - hatched and raised chicks . The tool is used on all kiwi species except little spotted kiwi . </P> <H3> 1080 poison </H3> Main article : 1080 usage in New Zealand <P> In 2004 , anti-1080 activist Phillip Anderton posed for the New Zealand media with a kiwi he claimed had been poisoned . An investigation revealed that Anderton lied to journalists and the public . He had used a kiwi that had been caught in a possum trap . Extensive monitoring shows that kiwi are not at risk from the use of biodegradable 1080 poison . </P> <H3> Threats </H3> <P> Introduced mammalian predators , namely stoats , dogs , ferrets , and cats , are the number one threat to kiwi . Other threats include habitat modification / loss and motor vehicle strike . The restricted distribution and small size of some kiwi populations increases their vulnerability to inbreeding . </P> <P> Stoats are responsible for approximately half of kiwi chick deaths in many areas through New Zealand . Cats also to a lesser extent prey on kiwi chicks . Research has shown that the combined effect of predators and other mortality ( accidents etc . ) results in less than 5 % of kiwi chicks surviving to adulthood . Young kiwi chicks are vulnerable to stoat predation until they reach about 1 -- 1.2 kg in weight , at which time they can usually defend themselves . </P> <P> Ferrets and dogs often kill adult kiwi . These predators can cause large and abrupt declines in populations . In particular , dogs find the distinctive strong scent of kiwi irresistible and easy to track , such that they can catch and kill kiwi in seconds . Motor vehicle strike is a threat to all kiwi where roads cross through their habitat . Badly set possum traps often kill or maim kiwi . </P> <H2> Relationship to humans </H2> Detail of the bottom edge of a kahu kiwi , showing the distinctive hair - like nature of the kiwi feathers . <P> The Māori traditionally believed that kiwi were under the protection of Tane Mahuta , god of the forest . They were used as food and their feathers were used for kahu kiwi -- ceremonial cloaks . Today , while kiwi feathers are still used , they are gathered from birds that die naturally or through road accidents or predation , or from captive birds . Kiwi are no longer hunted and some Maori consider themselves the birds ' guardians . </P> <H3> Scientific documentation </H3> <P> In 1813 , George Shaw named the genus Apteryx in his species description of the southern brown kiwi , which he called `` the southern apteryx '' . Captain Andrew Barclay of the ship Providence provided Shaw with the specimen . Shaw 's description was accompanied by two plates , engraved by Frederick Polydore Nodder ; they were published in volume 24 of The Naturalist 's Miscellany . </P> <H3> Zoos </H3> <P> In 1851 , London Zoo became the first zoo to keep kiwi . The first captive breeding took place in 1945 . As of 2007 only 13 zoos outside New Zealand hold kiwi . The Frankfurt Zoo has 12 , the Berlin Zoo has seven , Walsrode Bird Park has one , the Avifauna Bird Park in the Netherlands has three , the San Diego Zoo has five , the San Diego Zoo Safari Park has one , the National Zoo in Washington , DC has eleven , the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute has one , and the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium has three . </P> <H3> As a national symbol </H3> See also : National symbols of New Zealand The kiwi on an 1898 New Zealand stamp <P> The kiwi as a symbol first appeared in the late 19th century in New Zealand regimental badges . It was later featured in the badges of the South Canterbury Battalion in 1886 and the Hastings Rifle Volunteers in 1887 . Soon after , the kiwi appeared in many military badges ; and in 1906 , when Kiwi Shoe Polish was widely sold in the UK and the US , the symbol became more widely known . </P> <P> During the First World War , the name `` kiwi '' for New Zealand soldiers came into general use , and a giant kiwi ( now known as the Bulford kiwi ) , was carved on the chalk hill above Sling Camp in England . Usage has become so widespread that all New Zealanders overseas and at home are now commonly referred to as `` Kiwis '' . </P> <P> The kiwi has since become the most well - known national symbol for New Zealand , and the bird is prominent in the coat of arms , crests and badges of many New Zealand cities , clubs and organisations ; at the national level , the red silhouette of a kiwi is in the centre of the roundel of the Royal New Zealand Air Force . The kiwi is featured in the logo of the New Zealand Rugby League , and the New Zealand national rugby league team are nicknamed the Kiwis . </P> <P> The reverse of a New Zealand dollar coin contains an image of a kiwi , and in currency trading the New Zealand dollar is often referred to as `` the kiwi '' . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> Birds of New Zealand </Li> <Li> Conservation in New Zealand </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <H3> Notes </H3> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Brands , Sheila ( 14 August 2008 ) . `` Systema Naturae 2000 / Classification , Family Apterygidae '' .

In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Types <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Transactional emails </Li> <Li> 2.2 Direct emails <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Mobile email marketing </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Comparison to traditional mail <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Advantages </Li> <Li> 3.2 Disadvantages </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Opt - in email advertising </Li> <Li> 5 Legal requirements <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Australia </Li> <Li> 5.2 Canada </Li> <Li> 5.3 European Union </Li> <Li> 5.4 United States </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History </H2> <P> Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . </P> <P> Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured . </P> <H2> Types </H2> <P> Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : </P> <H3> Transactional emails </H3> <P> Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . </P> <P> The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . </P> <P> Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . </P> <H3> Direct emails </H3> <P> Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . </P> Mobile email marketing <P> Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy . </P> <H2> Comparison to traditional mail </H2> <P> There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail . </P> <H3> Advantages </H3> <P> Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons : </P> <Ul> <Li> An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic . </Li> <Li> Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission . </P> <P> In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages . </P> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> CAUCE -- Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial Email </Li> <Li> Customer engagement </Li> <Li> Suppression list </Li> <Li> Email spam - Unsolicited email marketing </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` spam unsolicited e-mail '' .

In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads .

Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured . Types Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : Transactional emails Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . Direct emails Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . Mobile email marketing Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are   \n",

The show , narrated by Future Ted , tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother . Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in `` Something New '' and was promoted to a main character in season 9 . The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti . The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series , including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment . Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky 's wedding ; this scene is shown in `` Last Forever '' , the series finale . The Mother 's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024 , also revealed in the series finale , received a mixed reaction from fans . An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD . In the alternate ending , Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . In the video , future Ted is heard saying , `` ... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning , I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was ... '' , indirectly stating that The Mother is alive . The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling , implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby . Contents ( hide ) 1 Casting 2 Character history 2.1 Name 3 Death 4 Notes 5 References Casting ( edit ) During its first eight seasons , the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother . Well - known actresses often made guest appearances on the show . Many fans expected that another would play one of the most - wanted roles in Hollywood , but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown . Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples , Thomas said that `` We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience '' , similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had `` kept the show alive '' when it began . Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call . They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once ; her musical ability was also helpful , as The Mother had been described as a band member . After competing for the role against at least two others , Milioti filmed her first scene -- for the last episode of season 8 -- having never watched How I Met Your Mother ; she recalled , `` I had ignorance on my side . So I did n't know what it meant . '' Milioti learned of the character 's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer . Character history ( edit ) The Mother was born on September 19 , 1984 . The Mother , joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death . After the funeral service , she returns to the apartment to open Max 's last gift to her -- a ukulele . The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love . In `` Wait for It '' , it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella . In `` No Tomorrow '' , Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick 's Day party which she also attended , as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max , her late boyfriend . She is still grieving , but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again , bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating . The two women run into Mitch , her old orchestra instructor ; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment . After they start talking , Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams . The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college . On his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby , as seen in the season                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

Note that the picture shows several stages of one and the same spermatozoon - only one penetrates the ovum Illustration depicting ovulation and fertilization . Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm , usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell , or fertilized egg , initiating prenatal development . Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century . The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb , in vitro .

Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell , known as zygote . The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism . Cone of attraction and perivitelline membrane ( edit ) Where the spermatozoon is about to pierce , the yolk ( ooplasm ) is drawn out into a conical elevation , termed the cone of attraction or reception cone . Once the spermatozoon has entered , the peripheral portion of the yolk changes into a membrane , the perivitelline membrane , which prevents the passage of additional spermatozoa . Sperm preparation ( edit ) Further information : Acrosome reaction At the beginning of the process , the sperm undergoes a series of changes , as freshly ejaculated sperm is unable or poorly able to fertilize . The sperm must undergo capacitation in the female 's reproductive tract over several hours , which increases its motility and destabilizes its membrane , preparing it for the acrosome reaction , the enzymatic penetration of the egg 's tough membrane , the zona pellucida , which surrounds the oocyte . Zona pellucida ( edit ) After binding to the corona radiata the sperm reaches the zona pellucida , which is an extra-cellular matrix of glycoproteins . A special complementary molecule on the surface of the sperm head binds to a ZP3 glycoprotein in the zona pellucida . This binding triggers the acrosome to burst , releasing enzymes that help the sperm get through the zona pellucida . Some sperm cells consume their acrosome prematurely on the surface of the egg cell , facilitating the penetration by other sperm cells . As a population , sperm cells have on average 50 % genome similarity so the premature acrosomal reactions aid fertilization by a member of the same cohort . It may be regarded as a mechanism of kin selection . Recent studies have shown that the egg is not passive during this process . Cortical reaction ( edit ) Once the sperm cells find their way past the zona pellucida , the cortical reaction occurs . Cortical granules inside the secondary oocyte fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell , causing enzymes inside these granules to be expelled by exocytosis to the zona pellucida . This in turn causes the glyco - proteins in the zona pellucida to cross-link with each other -- i.e. the enzymes cause the ZP2 to hydrolyse into ZP2f -- making the whole matrix hard and impermeable to sperm . This prevents fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm . The cortical reaction and acrosome reaction are both essential to ensure that only one sperm will fertilize an egg . Fusion ( edit ) Fertilization and implantation in humans . After the sperm enters the cytoplasm of the oocyte ( also called ovocyte ) , the tail and the outer coating of the sperm disintegrate and the cortical reaction takes place , preventing other sperm from fertilizing the same egg . The oocyte now undergoes its second meiotic division producing the haploid ovum and releasing a polar body . The sperm nucleus then fuses with the ovum , enabling fusion of their genetic material . Cell membranes ( edit ) The fusion of cell membranes of the secondary oocyte and sperm takes place . Transformations ( edit ) In preparation for the fusion of their genetic material both the oocyte and the sperm undergo transformations as a reaction to the fusion of cell membranes . The oocyte completes its second meiotic division . This results in a mature ovum . The nucleus                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

History Established 1585 Birth of Virginia Dare August 18 , 1587 Abandoned Before August c. 1590 Found abandoned August 18 , 1590 Population 1587 116 Today part of United States Dare County , North Carolina The Roanoke Colony ( / ˈroʊəˌnoʊk / ) , also known as the Lost Colony , was established in 1585 on Roanoke Island in what is today 's Dare County , North Carolina . It was a late 16th - century attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent English settlement in North America . The colony was founded by Sir Walter Raleigh . The colonists disappeared during the Anglo - Spanish War , three years after the last shipment of supplies from England . Their disappearance gave rise to the nickname `` The Lost Colony '' . There is no conclusive evidence as to what happened to the colonists .

Sir Humphrey Gilbert 's half - brother Sir Walter Raleigh later gained his brother 's charter from the Queen and subsequently executed the details of the charter through his delegates Ralph Lane and Richard Grenville , Raleigh 's distant cousin . Raleigh 's charter A watercolor of the fort in Guyanailla Bay , which is likely similar to the fort constructed on Roanoke On March 25 , 1584 , Queen Elizabeth I granted Raleigh a charter for the colonization of the area of North America . This charter specified that Raleigh needed to establish a colony in North America , or lose his right to colonization . The Queen and Raleigh intended that the venture should provide riches from the New World . The queen 's charter said that Raleigh was supposed to `` discover , search , find out , and view such remote heathen and barbarous Lands , Countries , and territories ... to have , hold , occupy , and enjoy '' . The queen 's charter also said that Raleigh was supposed to establish a base from which to send privateers on raids against the treasure fleets of Spain . The purpose of these raids was to tell Spain that England was ready for war . The original charter basically told Raleigh to establish a military base to counteract the activities of the Spaniards . Raleigh himself never visited North America , although he led expeditions in 1595 and 1617 to South America 's Orinoco River basin in search of the legendary golden city of El Dorado . First Voyages to Roanoke Island On April 27 , 1584 , Raleigh dispatched an expedition led by Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe to explore the eastern coast of North America . They arrived on Roanoke Island on July 4 and soon established relations with the local natives , the Secotans and Croatans . Barlowe returned to England with two Croatans named Manteo and Wanchese , who were able to describe the politics and geography of the area to Raleigh . Based on the information given , Raleigh organized a second expedition , to be led by Sir Richard Grenville . Sir Walter Raleigh Grenville 's fleet departed Plymouth on April 9 , 1585 , with five main ships : Tiger ( Grenville 's ) , Roebuck , Red Lion , Elizabeth , and Dorothy . A severe storm off the coast of Portugal separated Tiger from the rest of the fleet . The captains had a contingency plan if they were separated , which was to meet up again in Puerto Rico , and Tiger arrived in the `` Baye of Muskito '' ( Guayanilla Bay ) on May 11 . While waiting for the other ships , Grenville established relations with the resident Spanish while simultaneously engaging in some privateering against them . He also built a fort . Elizabeth arrived soon after the fort 's construction . Grenville eventually tired of waiting for the remaining ships and departed on June 7 . The fort was abandoned , and its location remains unknown . Tiger sailed through Ocracoke Inlet on June 26 , but it struck a shoal , ruining most of the food supplies . The expedition succeeded in repairing the ship and , in early July , reunited with Roebuck and Dorothy , which had arrived in the Outer Banks with Red Lion some weeks previous . Red Lion had dropped off its passengers and left for Newfoundland for privateering . In the New World During the initial exploration of the mainland                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads .

Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns . Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured . Types Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails : Transactional emails Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts . The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services . Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) . Direct emails Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used . Mobile email marketing Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are</td>\n",

The show , narrated by Future Ted , tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother . Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in `` Something New '' and was promoted to a main character in season 9 . The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti . The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series , including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment . Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky 's wedding ; this scene is shown in `` Last Forever '' , the series finale . The Mother 's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024 , also revealed in the series finale , received a mixed reaction from fans . An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD . In the alternate ending , Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . In the video , future Ted is heard saying , `` ... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning , I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was ... '' , indirectly stating that The Mother is alive . The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling , implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby . Contents ( hide ) 1 Casting 2 Character history 2.1 Name 3 Death 4 Notes 5 References Casting ( edit ) During its first eight seasons , the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother . Well - known actresses often made guest appearances on the show . Many fans expected that another would play one of the most - wanted roles in Hollywood , but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown . Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples , Thomas said that `` We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience '' , similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had `` kept the show alive '' when it began . Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call . They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once ; her musical ability was also helpful , as The Mother had been described as a band member . After competing for the role against at least two others , Milioti filmed her first scene -- for the last episode of season 8 -- having never watched How I Met Your Mother ; she recalled , `` I had ignorance on my side . So I did n't know what it meant . '' Milioti learned of the character 's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer . Character history ( edit ) The Mother was born on September 19 , 1984 . The Mother , joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death . After the funeral service , she returns to the apartment to open Max 's last gift to her -- a ukulele . The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love .

Note that the picture shows several stages of one and the same spermatozoon - only one penetrates the ovum Illustration depicting ovulation and fertilization . Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm , usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell , or fertilized egg , initiating prenatal development . Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century . The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb , in vitro .

Fertilization occurs when the nucleus of both a sperm and an egg fuse to form a diploid cell , known as zygote . The successful fusion of gametes forms a new organism . Cone of attraction and perivitelline membrane ( edit ) Where the spermatozoon is about to pierce , the yolk ( ooplasm ) is drawn out into a conical elevation , termed the cone of attraction or reception cone . Once the spermatozoon has entered , the peripheral portion of the yolk changes into a membrane , the perivitelline membrane , which prevents the passage of additional spermatozoa . Sperm preparation ( edit ) Further information : Acrosome reaction At the beginning of the process , the sperm undergoes a series of changes , as freshly ejaculated sperm is unable or poorly able to fertilize . The sperm must undergo capacitation in the female 's reproductive tract over several hours , which increases its motility and destabilizes its membrane , preparing it for the acrosome reaction , the enzymatic penetration of the egg 's tough membrane , the zona pellucida , which surrounds the oocyte . Zona pellucida ( edit ) After binding to the corona radiata the sperm reaches the zona pellucida , which is an extra-cellular matrix of glycoproteins . A special complementary molecule on the surface of the sperm head binds to a ZP3 glycoprotein in the zona pellucida . This binding triggers the acrosome to burst , releasing enzymes that help the sperm get through the zona pellucida . Some sperm cells consume their acrosome prematurely on the surface of the egg cell , facilitating the penetration by other sperm cells . As a population , sperm cells have on average 50 % genome similarity so the premature acrosomal reactions aid fertilization by a member of the same cohort . It may be regarded as a mechanism of kin selection . Recent studies have shown that the egg is not passive during this process . Cortical reaction ( edit ) Once the sperm cells find their way past the zona pellucida , the cortical reaction occurs . Cortical granules inside the secondary oocyte fuse with the plasma membrane of the cell , causing enzymes inside these granules to be expelled by exocytosis to the zona pellucida . This in turn causes the glyco - proteins in the zona pellucida to cross-link with each other -- i.e. the enzymes cause the ZP2 to hydrolyse into ZP2f -- making the whole matrix hard and impermeable to sperm . This prevents fertilization of an egg by more than one sperm . The cortical reaction and acrosome reaction are both essential to ensure that only one sperm will fertilize an egg . Fusion ( edit ) Fertilization and implantation in humans . After the sperm enters the cytoplasm of the oocyte ( also called ovocyte ) , the tail and the outer coating of the sperm disintegrate and the cortical reaction takes place , preventing other sperm from fertilizing the same egg . The oocyte now undergoes its second meiotic division producing the haploid ovum and releasing a polar body . The sperm nucleus then fuses with the ovum , enabling fusion of their genetic material . Cell membranes ( edit ) The fusion of cell membranes of the secondary oocyte and sperm takes place . Transformations ( edit ) In preparation for the fusion of their genetic material both the oocyte and the sperm undergo transformations as a reaction to the fusion of cell membranes . The oocyte completes its second meiotic division . This results in a mature ovum . The nucleus</td>\n",

It was a late 16th - century attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent English settlement in North America . The colony was founded by Sir Walter Raleigh . The colonists disappeared during the Anglo - Spanish War , three years after the last shipment of supplies from England . Their disappearance gave rise to the nickname `` The Lost Colony '' . There is no conclusive evidence as to what happened to the colonists .

Sir Humphrey Gilbert 's half - brother Sir Walter Raleigh later gained his brother 's charter from the Queen and subsequently executed the details of the charter through his delegates Ralph Lane and Richard Grenville , Raleigh 's distant cousin . Raleigh 's charter A watercolor of the fort in Guyanailla Bay , which is likely similar to the fort constructed on Roanoke On March 25 , 1584 , Queen Elizabeth I granted Raleigh a charter for the colonization of the area of North America . This charter specified that Raleigh needed to establish a colony in North America , or lose his right to colonization . The Queen and Raleigh intended that the venture should provide riches from the New World . The queen 's charter said that Raleigh was supposed to `` discover , search , find out , and view such remote heathen and barbarous Lands , Countries , and territories ... to have , hold , occupy , and enjoy '' . The queen 's charter also said that Raleigh was supposed to establish a base from which to send privateers on raids against the treasure fleets of Spain . The purpose of these raids was to tell Spain that England was ready for war . The original charter basically told Raleigh to establish a military base to counteract the activities of the Spaniards . Raleigh himself never visited North America , although he led expeditions in 1595 and 1617 to South America 's Orinoco River basin in search of the legendary golden city of El Dorado . First Voyages to Roanoke Island On April 27 , 1584 , Raleigh dispatched an expedition led by Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe to explore the eastern coast of North America . They arrived on Roanoke Island on July 4 and soon established relations with the local natives , the Secotans and Croatans . Barlowe returned to England with two Croatans named Manteo and Wanchese , who were able to describe the politics and geography of the area to Raleigh . Based on the information given , Raleigh organized a second expedition , to be led by Sir Richard Grenville . Sir Walter Raleigh Grenville 's fleet departed Plymouth on April 9 , 1585 , with five main ships : Tiger ( Grenville 's ) , Roebuck , Red Lion , Elizabeth , and Dorothy . A severe storm off the coast of Portugal separated Tiger from the rest of the fleet . The captains had a contingency plan if they were separated , which was to meet up again in Puerto Rico , and Tiger arrived in the `` Baye of Muskito '' ( Guayanilla Bay ) on May 11 . While waiting for the other ships , Grenville established relations with the resident Spanish while simultaneously engaging in some privateering against them . He also built a fort . Elizabeth arrived soon after the fort 's construction . Grenville eventually tired of waiting for the remaining ships and departed on June 7 . The fort was abandoned , and its location remains unknown . Tiger sailed through Ocracoke Inlet on June 26 , but it struck a shoal , ruining most of the food supplies . The expedition succeeded in repairing the ship and , in early July , reunited with Roebuck and Dorothy , which had arrived in the Outer Banks with Red Lion some weeks previous . Red Lion had dropped off its passengers and left for Newfoundland for privateering . In the New World During the initial exploration of the mainland</td>\n",
